# Power-Bi-Project
**OBJECTIVES**
-To identify the prevalence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and panic attacks among students.
-To understand how mental health issues vary by gender, age, course, and year of study.
-To explore the relationship between mental health issues and academic performance (CGPA).

**CONCLUSION**
The dashboard aimed to make the data sets(Student's Mental Health) understandable to the viewers. As you can see, we have different charts to help the viewers understand and explain the data well. We have a pie chart, to determine the number of males and females involved in the survey. The vertically stacked bar chart, indicates the relationship between the current year of the student, its issues (Depression, Anxiety, panic attacks), and the number of students seeking help from the experts. We also have a table of age, course, and number of students seeking help. Last, we have a card that indicates the number of students, % of the students who have issues, and % of students who seek help from experts.


Overall it concludes that the majority of students that have issues such as depression, anxiety, and panic are first-year which has 43 students (41.585). Females are dominant in that, and 2.97% of the students seek help from the experts. Followed by second-year students, third-year students, and fourth-year students.
